- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, shap

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
3. Place the dataset in the `data/` folder.
4. Run the scripts in the following order:
   - `code/data_preprocessing.py`
   - `code/model_training.py`
